            <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<h4 id="by-andrea-jackson">By Andrea Jackson</h4>
<p>The Recreational Sports department of VCU is seeking to understand if their various in house training programs contribute to the professional development of the students involved. The training programs studied include Ace Prep Group Exercise training, Ace Prep personal training and the Student Outdoor Leadership program (SOLE).In order to assess professional development the  Working Styles Assessment was given to all students  prior to and after their training programs to answer the following questions: are there differences inherent among the types of students involved in each program as seen by their WSA score and can any increase in WSA scores be attributed to each program.</p>
<h3 id="1-working-styles-assessment-background">1. Working Styles Assessment Background</h3>
<p>The Working Styles Assessment scores work-related personality traits associated with  effective job performance.The personality trait scores are aggregated into an overall score which for assessment analysis.The goal of the assessment is to help users and hiring managers understand the users work preferences and approaches.</p>
<h3 id="11-wsa-sub-scores">1.1 WSA sub-scores</h3>
<p>The WSA traits scored include the following: Achievement, Initiative, Persistence, Leadership, Cooperation, Concern for others, Social Orientation, Self-Control, Stress Tolerance, Adaptability, Dependability,Attention to Detail, Integrity, Conscientiousness, Independence, Innovation and Analytical Thinking.</p>
<h3 id="2-methods">2. Methods</h3>
<p>To determine if there are significant differences among values this study used Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and an ad-hoc Tukey test. Additionally, the method this study used to determine if the training programs were responsible for any increases in the pre and post scores was a paired two sample T-test. All analyses were done in the JMP program.</p>
<h3 id="21-assumptions">2.1 Assumptions</h3>
<p>The assumptions necessary to use ANOVA and the two sample T test in an analysis are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Normal distribution in the data</li>
<li>Homogeneity of variance.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following JMP output indicates that the assumptions were met:
<img src="/images/assumptions.PNG" alt="asumptions">
*alpha = .05, with the exception of Bartlett all tests show Homogeneity of variance is met.</p>
<h3 id="3-differences-among-programs">3. Differences among programs</h3>
<p>The following JMP output shows that although there is a large variability of scores among the Recreational sports training groups, this can be attributed to the fact that there are more data available in Ace Prep Group Exercise  vs Ace Prep personal training and SOLE. 
<img src="/images/anova.PNG" alt="anova"></p>
<p><img src="/images/tukey.PNG" alt="tukey test"></p>
<p>The scores among the 3 groups were not significantly different from one another.
Given that there is not a significant difference among the groups it would be appropriate further analyze the groups as a whole in the pre- and post-.</p>
<h3 id="4-pre--and-post--assessment">4. Pre- and Post- Assessment</h3>
<p>The null hypothesis for  the Pre- and Post- t-test is to assume there is not a significant difference between the Pre- and Post test scores. Assuming that the probability of getting a false positive ie alpha &lt; 5%, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude among groupâ€™s pre and post scores that although there is a difference between the scores the difference is not significant enough to conclude that the intervention ie the training was the cause.</p>
<p><img src="/images/t-test.PNG" alt="t-test"></p>
<h3 id="41-pre-and-post-assessment-sub-scores">4.1 Pre and Post Assessment sub-scores</h3>
<p>The WSA included subscores for various personality traits. The only sub-scores found to be significantly different was Social Orientation measured by WSA as the ability to work with others, display friendliness and be outgoing.
The JMP output for Social Orientation is shown below:</p>
<p><img src="/images/sub-score.PNG" alt="t-test"></p>
<h3 id="5conclusion">5.Conclusion</h3>
<p>This assessment was able to determine that differences among students in WSA do not exist for incoming students prior to entering their respective training programs. However the programs were found to have an effect on the Social Orientation score of the WSA.Given the importance of working with others in personal fitness careers,students can develop professionally from the Ace Prep group exercise, Ace Prep personal training and SOLE programs.</p>
