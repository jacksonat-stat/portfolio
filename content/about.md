I am a Statistician with background in health care policy.
 
I am experienced in using advanced statistical analysis, linear and non-linear 
regression and data visualization techniques to present findings. I primarily work using SQL, 
Rstudio, SAS and Tableau for my data projects.

My strengths include using the most efficient statistical methods to solve complex problems and communicating those methods and results in a way
that is clear and accessible
